        <h2><span class = "fact-head">Extent of Drying Lands</span></h2>
        <p>According to <a class ="fact-link" href ="https://time.com/7201214/three-quarters-of-the-earth-has-gotten-permanently-drier/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target ="_blank">Time</a>, a United Nations report warns that climate change caused by humans has brought permanent global dryness, where 77.6% of the land on our planet has experienced long-term aridity between 1990 and 2020. Throughout this period, drylands expanded by 4.3 million square kilometers‚Äîan area larger than India‚Äîleading to economic loss, forced displacement, escalating wildfires, and degradation of the environment. Unlike reversible temporary droughts, this alteration is permanent, and this causes urgent questions about the future of food security and human displacement.</p>

        <h2><span class = "fact-head">Impact on Agriculture</span></h2>
        <p>Desertification severely affects agricultural productivity. In regions like sub-Saharan Africa, significant reductions in crop yields are anticipated, exacerbating food insecurity and economic challenges.</p>

    <div class = "fact">
        <img class = "fact-img"  src = "./images/displace.jpg" alt = "Residents affected by desertification"/>
        <h2><span class = "fact-head">Human Displacement</span></h2>
        <p>The degradation of land contributes to forced migrations, as communities are compelled to leave areas where agriculture and livelihoods are no longer sustainable. ‚Äã</p>

        <h2><span class = "fact-head">Health Consequences</span></h2>
        <p>Aridification leads to health issues such as increased childhood stunting and reduced water supplies, particularly in vulnerable regions.</p>
        <ul class = "bullet">
            <li>higher threats of malnutrition from reduced food and water supplies</li>
            <li>more water- and food-borne diseases that result from poor hygiene and a lack of clean water</li>
            <li>respiratory diseases caused by atmospheric dust from wind erosion and other air pollutants</li>
            <li>the spread of infectious diseases as populations migrate.</li>

        <h2><span class = "fact-head">Global Initiatives</span></h2>
        <p>In December 2024, the Climate Investment Funds (CIF) approved a $500 million initiative to aid Ethiopia in restoring degraded lands, protecting forests, and enhancing food security. This program aims to restore over 320,000 hectares across various regions.</p>

        <h2><span class = "fact-head">Sustainable Agriculture</span></h2>
        <p>Adopting drought-resistant crops and efficient irrigation methods are essential strategies to mitigate the impacts of desertification on agriculture.</p>
