        <h2><span class = "fact-head">Extent of Drying Lands</span></h2>
        <p>Over the past 30 years, approximately 77.6% of Earth's land areas have become drier due to human-induced climate change. This trend has led to the expansion of drylands by about 4.3 million square kilometers globally.</p>

        <h2><span class = "fact-head">Impact on Agriculture</span></h2>
        <p>Desertification severely affects agricultural productivity. In regions like sub-Saharan Africa, significant reductions in crop yields are anticipated, exacerbating food insecurity and economic challenges.</p>

        <h2><span class = "fact-head">Human Displacement</span></h2>
        <p>The degradation of land contributes to forced migrations, as communities are compelled to leave areas where agriculture and livelihoods are no longer sustainable. â€‹</p>

        <h2><span class = "fact-head">Health Consequences</span></h2>
        <p>Aridification leads to health issues such as increased childhood stunting and reduced water supplies, particularly in vulnerable regions.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>higher threats of malnutrition from reduced food and water supplies</li>
            <li>more water- and food-borne diseases that result from poor hygiene and a lack of clean water</li>
            <li>respiratory diseases caused by atmospheric dust from wind erosion and other air pollutants</li>
            <li>the spread of infectious diseases as populations migrate.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><span class = "fact-head">Global Initiatives</span></h2>
        <p>In December 2024, the Climate Investment Funds (CIF) approved a $500 million initiative to aid Ethiopia in restoring degraded lands, protecting forests, and enhancing food security. This program aims to restore over 320,000 hectares across various regions.</p>

        <h2><span class = "fact-head">Sustainable Agriculture</span></h2>
        <p>Adopting drought-resistant crops and efficient irrigation methods are essential strategies to mitigate the impacts of desertification on agriculture.</p>
